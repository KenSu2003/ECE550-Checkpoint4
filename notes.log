# FAIL: r4 was never observed written (observed value 0x00000000)
EXPECTED since we never used Register $4

# FAIL: r23 was never observed written (observed value 0x00000000)
EXPECTED since when there is an overflow, only the rstatus is written (to r30).

# FAIL: r21 expected 0x00000014 observed 0x0000000f
# FAIL: r22 expected 0x0000000f observed 0x00000014
These two values seems to be swapped.

Fixed by:

// DFFEs to store the instructions
genvar i;
generate
    for (i = 0; i < 12; i = i + 1) begin : pc_reg_gen
        dffe_ref pc_dffe_i (
            .q(pc[i]),
            .d(pc_next[i]),
            .clk(clock),
            .en(1'b1),
            .clr(reset)
        );
    end
endgenerate
