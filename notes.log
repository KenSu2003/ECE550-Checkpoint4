# FAIL: r4 was never observed written (observed value 0x00000000)
EXPECTED since we never used Register $4

———————————————————————— LW issue ————————————————————————

# FAIL: r21 expected 0x00000014 observed 0x0000000f
# FAIL: r22 expected 0x0000000f observed 0x00000014
These two values seems to be swapped.

————————————————————————— Overflow issue —————————————————————————

# FAIL: r23 was never observed written (observed value 0x00000000)
Should exit
# Now compute $23 = $29 - $12  => 0x80000000 - 1 => 0x7FFFFFFF -> signed overflow
sub  $23, $29, $12       # causes overflow -> rstatus = 3 in $30

# FAIL: r30 expected 0x00000002 observed 0x00000001
addi $31, $31, 1          # overflow -> $30 should be set to 2 (check rstatus immed after this)
Overflow seems to be inclrrect
